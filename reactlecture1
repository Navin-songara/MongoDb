it compare preloaded DOM and access only changed information form server and update client side. 
SPA reduce network load and save time.
in SPA application only required information will submit on server and return from server.
SPA save page reloading time.
React js is used to create dynamic component and Reusable component.
component :- small part of web application. it support modular structure progrogramming .
reactjs support asynchrnous programming .
react js support oops concepts.
types of component:- 
1.class component
2.function component 
1.class component :- class and object based component.class component follow oops concepts.
it is base technology for component development.
syntax:- 
import React from "react", // link library 
import {Component} from "react";
//componentName extends Component 
{
    //define data members or variables
    //data members of a component are called as state.
    construtor()
    {
        super(),//call base class construtor 
        //define state 
        this.state={variablename:initialvalue,-----}
    }
    //define function or event
    eventName=(evt)=>
    {
        --
        --
    }
    //define layout or design 
    render()  //render function is used to define of webpage 
    {
        return(
            --- jsx advance java script for designing 
            --- we can define html inside the java script
        );
    }
}expert default ComponentName;

2.function component :- advance of class component.
function component process fast as compare to class component.save.time,reduce code size.
syntax:-
import React,{useState}from "react";
//useState :- is known as hook.and it provides functionality to define global variable or state in function component.
function ComponentName()
{
    //define data member or state 
    cons[variable,setVariableName]=useState();
    --
    --
    //define event
    const eventName=(evt)=>{
        --
        --
    }
    //define method
    const functionName()=>{
        -- --
    }
    //define layout
    return(
        --
        --
    );
}expert default ComponentName;

        install React JS
    open terminal or command prompt
>npm install create-react-app -g (run this command only one this-this is global or macine level installation)
Then
    create react application
    >npx create-react-app application (run this command whenever you want to create new application)
